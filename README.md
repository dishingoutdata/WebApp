# Web App for Data Collection

This is a smaller version of a larger project. This particular version of the project collects user data and stores it in a postgresql database. The larger project will also query the database for statistics and send out results to the user. I based this program on height collection to find average height of all users in the database, but you can use this as a skeleton to implement it for any other type of data.
